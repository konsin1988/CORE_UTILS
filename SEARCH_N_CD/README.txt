/* Scd (search and change dir) utility.
/* Performs a recursive search for a folder with 
/* the name specified in the arguments 
/* (not the full path, but only the directory name) 
/* in my home directory (to use it, you need to correct 
/* the code for your home folder or for the folder 
/* in which you most often work). Once the folder 
/* is found, clears the terminal window and changes 
/* to that directory. It is convenient to work with 
/* if you are guided in your workspace and often 
/* jump from one branch to another: there is no need 
/* to write the full path, you just need to specify the folder name.
