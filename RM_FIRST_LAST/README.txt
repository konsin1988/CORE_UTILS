/* Mrm ("my rm") utility. 				*
/* Deletes all files in the current directory 		*
/* (including internal directories - the -r flag 	*
/* in the standard rm utility) starting (the f 		*
/* parameter) or ending (the l parameter) with 		*
/* the character sequence specified in the second 	*
/* parameter. There are many types of execution of 	*
/* this functionality, but all that I have come 	*
/* across are too cumbersome, and it was decided 	*
/* to write a utility "for myself".			*
